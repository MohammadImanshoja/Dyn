Consider a fish population called X. The following equation provides a very simple model of
fishery
˙X

The effects of fishing are modeled by a constant term −H which says that fish are caught
at a constant rate H > 0 independent of their population X (or, in other words, every day,
fisherman catch the same number of fish). In the absence of fishing, the population is assumed
to grow logistically.
(a) Show that, for suitably defined variables x, τ and h the system can be written in a dimensionless
form as
dx
dτ
= x(1 − x) − h
What are the units of x, τ and h?
(b) Plot the vector field for different values of h.
(c) Show that a bifurcation occurs at a certain critical value of h, called hcrit and explain in
words what happens at this bifurcation.
(d) Discuss the long-term behavior of the fish population for h < hcrit and h > hcrit and give
the biological interpretation in each case.
(e) What, in your opinion, is the main weak point of this model?
